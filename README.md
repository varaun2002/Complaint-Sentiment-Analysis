# Consumer Complaint Sentiment Analysis and Prediction
Consumer complaints provide critical insights into systemic issues within the financial services industry. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze consumer complaints, identify trends, and predict complaint resolution outcomes. By uncovering patterns across products, companies, and issues, this project enables businesses and regulators to proactively address consumer concerns.

Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of 42,000+ complaints, examining distributions by product, company, state, and submission channel.

Text Preprocessing & NLP: Cleaning consumer narratives (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization) for downstream modeling.

Supervised Learning Models: Predictive models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify company responses and timely resolution likelihood.

Topic Modeling: Leveraging unsupervised NLP methods (e.g., LDA) to uncover hidden themes within complaint narratives.

Actionable Insights: Insights into which products, companies, and issues generate the most disputes, informing both compliance and customer experience teams.

Technical Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, gensim

Machine Learning Techniques: Supervised classification, topic modeling, dimensionality reduction (PCA, TruncatedSVD for text)

Visualization Tools: Matplotlib & seaborn for trend and cluster visualization

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, anonymized sensitive fields, and normalized categorical variables.

Cleaned and transformed narrative text for NLP analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed complaint trends by product (credit reporting, mortgage, credit card, etc.).

Identified states and companies with the highest complaint volumes.

Predictive Modeling:

Trained classification models to predict timely company responses and resolution outcomes.

Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Topic Modeling & Segmentation:

Applied LDA and clustering to segment complaints into major thematic areas (e.g., billing errors, credit reporting issues, mortgage servicing).

Insights & Recommendations:

Highlighted systemic complaint patterns across financial products.

Suggested targeted policy interventions and company-level actions.

Business Value

This project provides a data-driven framework to improve consumer protection and organizational performance by:

Enhancing Customer Experience: Identifying and addressing recurring consumer pain points.

Improving Compliance Monitoring: Detecting systemic risk areas for regulators and financial institutions.

Optimizing Operations: Prioritizing resources for companies based on complaint clusters and predictive risk factors.
